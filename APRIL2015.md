#### Question 11
-[] UDP is less reliable than TCP.
[] Form validation should only be done in client side.
[] Cookies are only data, not program code.
[] Cookies cannot be used by third-party websites to track user browsing habits.
[] The "Remember Me" feature, where the user's login info is remembered and reused when the user comes back is implemented requries the use of persistent cookies.
[] In asynchronous communication, a user cannot interact with a webpage while new data is loaded from the server.
[] In a 3-tier architecture unconnected tiers should not communicate.
[] Using the universal selector (*) in a Javascript function to do DOM manipulation will increase the performance of your script.
[] XML representation is less verbose thant JSON(i.e., XML is using fewer words to describe a model than JSON), hence XML is the preferred data interchange format in online applications.
[] POST method can submit data without encoding.
